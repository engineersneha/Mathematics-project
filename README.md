# Data-driven discovery of dynamical systems for geophysical applications

Route 1 (SINDy)
---------------
- Data mining of observations
- System identification
- Prediction

Route 2 (uKF)
-------------
- Solution of ODE proposed by L. Dal Zillio et al.
- Correction via uKF for observations
- Prediction

Ideally, comparison of the two routes.
